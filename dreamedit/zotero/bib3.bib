	abstract = {tion of the {"Democracy} Unbound" project was to extend democracy in two dimensions: Range and scope. The former would give a wider range of people the vote. The latter would give people a wider scope of things to vote on. In practice, no doubt there is room to do much more of both. But whereas it would be democratically justifiable in an ideal world for democracy to be completely unbounded as regards range, even in an ideal world democracy ought to be subject to some limits internal to the logic of democracy itself as regards its scope.},

The analysis calls attention to the strengths and weaknesses of both types of indicators as well as the complementarities between them. It distinguishes between the views of experts and the results of surveys and assesses the merits of aggregate as opposed to individual governance indicators. Some simple principles are identified to guide the use and refinement of existing governance indicators and the development of future indicators. These include transparently disclosing diversity of indicators and exploiting complementarities among them, submitting all indicators to rigorous public and academic scrutiny, and being realistic in expectations of future indicators.},

	abstract = {Many Latin American countries democratized between 1975 and 2000, and research has confirmed that contemporary Latin Americans hold democratic political attitudes. Using {AmericasBarometer} surveys of 18 countries from 2008, we examine the commitment of Latin Americans to three democratic attitudes – preference for democracy over other forms of government, support for general participation rights, and tolerance for participation by system critics. We also explore the impact of personal resources, crime and corruption, evaluation of system performance, social capital, and the sociopolitical context on democratic attitudes. A preference for democracy and support for citizens’ participation rights are strong, but tolerance is lower than the other attitudes. Evidence is found for acculturation – that Latin Americans acquire democratic attitudes by living in democratic regimes and through education.},

	abstract = {onal theory suggests that power-sharing institutions have many important consequences, not least that they are most likely to facilitate accommodation and cooperation among leadership elites, making them most suitable for states struggling to achieve stable democracy and good governance in divided societies. This study compares a broad cross-section of countries worldwide, including many multiethnic states, to investigate the impact of formal power-sharing institutions {(PR} electoral systems and federalism) on several indicators of democratic stability and good governance. The research demonstrates three main findings: (i) worldwide, power-sharing constitutions combining {PR} and federalism remain relatively rare (only 13 out of 191 states); (ii) federalism was found to be unrelated to any of the indicators of good governance under comparison; and (iii) {PR} electoral systems, however, were positively related to some indicators of good governance, both worldwide and in multiethnic states. This provides strictly limited support for the larger claims made by consociational theory. Nevertheless, the implications for policymakers suggest that investing in basic human development is a consistently more reliable route to achieve stable democracy and good governance than constitutional design alone.},

	url = {http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1449781},
	abstract = {nt success of deliberative democratic theory and practice over the last two decades has been to show that ordinary citizens are capable of sophisticated political judgments, if they participate in focused, deliberative processes. Among the most interesting of these processes are minipublics. A minipublic is a deliberative forum consisting of 20-500 participants, focused on a particular issue, selected as a representative sample of the public affected by the issue, and convened for a period of time sufficient for participants to form considered opinions and judgments. While the basic structure of these processes is already well developed, the question of what minipublics might do for a democratic political system - how they might come to function within it - is less well understood. Minipublics have primarily been justified as a way of providing advice to decision-makers that represents considered public opinion, or more generally as one means of increasing citizen participation in decision-making. I suggest here that in addition to these “democratic” roles, minipublics can serve in two key trust-based functions. They can serve as trusted information proxies to guide citizens’ political judgments in the absence of informed, deliberative opinion in broader publics. And they can serve as anticipatory publics in rapidly developing policy areas that are likely to generate issues, but which do not (yet) have public opinion attached to them. Both roles enhance citizens’ capacities to divide their political labours between participation and trust in ways that enhance democratic norms.},

Events in the last couple of decades - from the rise of new social movements to the end to the Berlin Wall - have combined with shifts in the culture of expectations within political science to overtake most of our received definitions in these respects. I offer a conception of politics that focuses on the intersection of power and conflict, and argue that such a conception is more in accord with our political world today than are most common conceptions, especially in light of new concerns with democracy and democratization. Finally, I show how this conception illuminates our contemporary understandings of democracy.},
